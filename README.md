Clustering is the process of grouping similar objects together. Spectral clustering is a powerful technique for partitioning data into clusters based on the connectivity information within the data(adjacency matrix). His techniques leverages the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix constructed from pairwise similarities.
